        <h2>About Alice</h2>

        <p>Alice Yang grew up in Fujian Province, China.  Fujian is located on the southeast coast of China.  Fujian is world
            renown for tea production, in terms of both quantity and quality.  Many teas as grown in Fujian, including
            white tea and oolong tea.  Alice's family operates a tea farm.</p>

        <p>Alice grew up in a small, and there was no local hospital.  Her family used
            tea as a medicine rather than immediately going to the hospital.  For example, Alice would take white tea
            when she had a fever, and the fever would typically dissipate in a day or two.  If the fever lasted more
            than several days, her parents would take her to a hospital in a larger city.
        </p>

        <h3>Credentials</h3>
        <p>In 2010, Alice earned her "Base Level" certification as a tea artist.  In 2014, Alice earned her "Medium Level," and
        in 2019, Alice earned her "High Level" certification.  A variety of tests must be passed to advance forward
        at each step of this certification process.</p>
        <p>Alice is also studying to become a "tasting tea master."  She is currently certified as a "novice" tasting
        tea master, and she expects to become certified as a "medium" tasting tea master by the end of 2019.  Part of the
        testing for this certification involves taking "blind" taste tests and being able to idenfity specific types of
        tea, and eventually, the point of origin for the tea leaves used to brew the tea.</p>
